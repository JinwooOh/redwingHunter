# Red Wing Hunter
Web scraper for Red Wing Boots

## Motivation
I love boots, but itâ€™s quite expensive to buy a brand new one. I have a few favorite brands Red Wing, Alden, and Viberg.

Unlike others, Red Wing boots go on sale regularly. Popular sites for finding in sale products or factory 2nd products are Nordstrom Rack and Sierra Trading Post.

Because of that I occasionally check those websites to see if there are discounted Red Wing Boots.

Checking those sites every time are time-consuming. We have to visit two different sites and need to filter specific boots size. That makes me tackle this project.
